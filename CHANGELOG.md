### Added

- Capture → protocol → session foundation: privileged capture helper, PCAP/PCAPNG IO, direct packet decoding, batch session summaries, and native UI.
- App-level capacity limits are resolved from an injected `AppPolicy` at launch rather than hardcoded: workspace tabs, saved focus sets, and pinned hosts. Reaching a limit now explains itself instead of doing nothing.
- Settings now uses native toolbar tabs, consistent grouped cards, semantic Light/Dark surfaces, and tighter field and status layouts across every pane.
- Sparkle 2 provides signed Community updates through the public appcast, with one app-owned updater shared by the app menu and Settings, automatic-check/download preferences backed directly by Sparkle, and local builds kept manual-only.

### Fixed

- Improved the description shown for unencrypted HTTP traffic.

### Changed

- Helper compatibility now reads the bundled helper version, build, and protocol from the shared release version configuration instead of assuming they match the app version.
